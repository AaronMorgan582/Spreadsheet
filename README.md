# Spreadsheet
A Spreadsheet that has similar functionality to a very basic version of Google Sheets or Excel.

This repository holds the code for the Spreadsheet application that was built by Aaron Morgan and Xavier Davis.

The Spreadsheet is a representation of Model-View-Controller, because certain functionality is handled by different files.

 - The arithmetic for formulas entered are handled in Formula.cs and Evaluator.cs
 - The relationship between cells are handled in DependencyGraph.cs
 - The GUI is handled in SimpleSpreadsheetGUI.cs
